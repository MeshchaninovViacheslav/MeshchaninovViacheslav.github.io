  <summary>1. Pairformer </summary>

  What it is: a streamlined successor to the Evoformer. It iterates attention and triangular updates over the single and pair features but no longer keeps an MSA axis.
  Why 48 blocks? Empirically, this depth was the sweet spot in AF2 for capturing longâ€‘range geometry; AF3 preserves it but spends the saved MSA FLOPs on more tokens (all atoms, ligands, nucleic acids).

  <summary>2. Recycling loop </summary>

  As in AlphaFold 2 recycling loop is applied during training (with stop gradient) and inference. Typically four recycles are used.
